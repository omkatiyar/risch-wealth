  {
    q: 'What is RISCH Wealth?',
    a: 'RISCH Wealth Private Limited is a private wealth management firm based in Bengaluru. It was founded in 2014 by Rishiraj Maheshwari, a career private banker whose career includes Senior Private Banker at ICICI Securities and Edelweiss Financial Services.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who does RISCH Wealth work with?',
    a: 'RISCH works with a small number of clients directly. The profiles we see most often are business owners, entrepreneurs and founders, private clients and families, NRIs and global Indians, senior executives and professionals, and family offices looking for a second opinion.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can NRIs work with RISCH?',
    a: 'Yes. NRIs and global Indians are among the clients RISCH works with most often, typically where holdings sit across countries and the Indian portfolio needs a single point of accountability. Which funds and strategies are available depends on your country of residence and each product\'s rules, which we check before recommending anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does RISCH build and manage a portfolio?',
    a: 'In four steps that repeat for as long as you are a client. We understand your goals, liquidity needs, time horizon and ability to withstand losses; construct a diversified portfolio across Indian and international equity, fixed income, commodities and real estate; monitor it with regular reviews and rebalancing; and coordinate it with the rest of your family wealth and long-term financial decisions.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does the RISCH risk profiler work?',
    a: 'The risk profiler is an eight-question diagnostic that scores your time horizon and risk preference independently, then matches you to a recommended portfolio. You get an instant proposal with an allocation and hypothetical outcomes. It is a starting point for a conversation, not a substitute for one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which asset classes does RISCH allocate across?',
    a: 'Portfolios are built across domestic equity (large, mid and small cap, plus thematic and sectoral funds), international equity (US, Europe, Asia ex-Japan and Taiwan), fixed income (short, medium and long duration), commodities (gold and silver) and real estate (REITs and InvITs), sized to the client rather than a model.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does RISCH Wealth sell its own investment products?',
    a: 'No. RISCH has no proprietary fund, so recommendations align to the client, not a product shelf. Any deviation from the recommended portfolio is recorded, justified and signed by both parties.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I get started?',
    a: `Start with a conversation: email ${FIRM.email} or call ${FIRM.phone}, or use the contact page. If you'd like a first view beforehand, the risk profiler on this site produces a preliminary allocation in a few minutes.`,
