          <p><strong>Diagnostic framework &amp; scoring.</strong> This questionnaire synthesizes three principal dimensions: liquidity time horizon, expected return vs. drawdown tolerance, and behavioural loss aversion. Resulting scores map across a continuum from Conservative to Aggressive.</p>
          <p><strong>Holistic context.</strong> This questionnaire is a foundational tool. Overall net worth, debt obligations, non-liquid holdings, tax considerations and bespoke liquidity milestones should be reviewed before any allocation is finalised.</p>
